## Projects

### Master’s Dissertation - Deep Reinforcement-Learning For Portfolio Optimisation

[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/antoinechesnay-code/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-_Portfolio-Optimisation-Dissertation-) | [Read Dissertation](Uploads/Dissertation.pdf)

This dissertation investigates the integration of sentiment analysis with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for dynamic portfolio optimisation, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms. While baseline DRL models successfully outperformed the S&P 500 benchmark, the addition of sentiment signals from financial news unexpectedly degraded performance across both architectures. The study identifies key challenges in sentiment integration, including irregular news coverage and negative sentiment bias, which caused the models to adopt overly conservative strategies. Ultimately, the research demonstrates that while DRL is a powerful tool for portfolio management, successful sentiment integration is highly complex and requires sophisticated data handling and model design to avoid counterproductive outcomes.

### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Travel Recommendation System

[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/antoinechesnay-code/MARL_travel-system)

This project involved architecting a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to solve the dynamic resource allocation problem in travel planning. The system utilizes specialized agents for lodging, dining, and activity recommendations, governed by a central agent that controls budget distribution and adapts policies based on user preferences. Trained on a real-world UK travel dataset, the model dynamically generates optimal itineraries within budget constraints, with performance metrics and budget utilization visualized for analysis.

### Car Rental Management System

[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/antoinechesnay-code/Car_Rental_System )

Designed and implemented a complete car rental system using object-oriented programming principles. Built robust database management system for vehicle inventory and customer tracking. Also implemented automated booking and pricing algorithms.

### Bank Customer Churn model

[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/antoinechesnay-code/Bank-Customer-Churn )

This comprehensive data science project tackles the critical business challenge of customer churn in banking through advanced machine learning techniques. The analysis encompasses the complete data science pipeline from exploratory data analysis to model deployment, with a focus on identifying patterns and predictive features that indicate customer departure likelihood.
